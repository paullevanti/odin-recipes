<h2>Description</h2>

<p>We all love penguins. We all love food. Why not have both? 
    With this easy recipe, you can create a deliciously edible
    display of cute penguins with ease. Give them scarves or hats
    with little strips of peppers or pimentos!</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Black olives:</strong>18 large; pitted and 18 small (36)</li>
        <li><strong>Cream cheese:</strong> 1 (8 ounce) package; softened</li>
        <li><strong>Carrot:</strong>1 large</li>
    </ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Cut a slit from top to bottom, lengthwise, into the side
         of each jumbo olive. Carefully insert about 1 teaspoon of 
         cream cheese into each olive. Slice the carrot into eighteen
          1/4 inch thick rounds; cut a small notch out of each carrot
           slice to form feet. Save the cut out piece and press into 
           center of small olive to form the beak. If necessary cut 
           a small slit into each olive before inserting the beak.</li>
        <li>Set a big olive, large hole side down, onto a carrot
         slice. Then, set a small olive onto the large olive,
          adjusting so that the beak, cream cheese chest and 
          notch in the carrot slice line up. Secure with a 
          toothpick.</li>
